## Taewoong Park

I build backend systems for medical imaging — the kind where reliability isn't a feature, it's a requirement.

Day to day, I work on cloud and on-premise infrastructure that moves patient data through distributed pipelines. I spend most of my time in **Go** and **Python**, orchestrating workflows with **Temporal**, deploying on **Kubernetes**, and making sure nothing breaks in production.

I care about systems that are boring in the best way — predictable, observable, and hard to misuse.

### Things I work with

`Go` · `Python` · `TypeScript` · `gRPC / ConnectRPC` · `PostgreSQL` · `RabbitMQ` · `Docker` · `Kubernetes` · `AWS` · `Temporal` · `DICOM`

### Outside of work

Building things in the AI/open-source space when something catches my eye.
