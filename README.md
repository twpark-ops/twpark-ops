## Hey, I'm Taewoong Park

Backend engineer building **cloud & on-premise infrastructure** in the medical imaging domain.

I design distributed systems that handle real patient data — where downtime isn't an option and security isn't optional.

### What I do

- Architect and ship **cloud-native platforms** with hybrid on-premise deployment
- Build **workflow orchestration** systems with Temporal for complex distributed pipelines
- Design APIs with **gRPC / ConnectRPC** — REST only when there's no other choice
- Run production **Kubernetes clusters** on AWS with security-hardened containers
- Work with **DICOM** and medical imaging standards daily

### Outside of work

Exploring the AI open-source ecosystem — building developer tools, experimenting with LLM infrastructure, and occasionally making apps that have nothing to do with healthcare.
